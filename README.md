# Code Quiz

## Description

I have created a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores. 

When the user clicks on the start button, the timer starts. The user will be presented with 5 questions to be answered before the timer ends. The game is over either once the timer ends or when the user has answered all questions. After the quiz, the user can save their score by entering their name/initials. 

If the user wishes to see previous high scores, they can do so by clicking on the "high scores" link. The user may also choose to clear any high scores previously stored.

I followed this [tutorial](https://dev.to/madanlal/how-to-sort-array-of-object-using-object-keys-in-javascript-58f1) to create a function that would sort the saved scores in descending order
